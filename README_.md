- start the project and click get dependency when prompt.
- or open pubspec.yaml and click pub get.

PS: regarding this note
  - Although this is a Flutter Engineer role, if you think you will be able to demonstrate better
  your skills writing native Android or iOS and is willing to work with Flutter,
  feel free to implement it with the framework you feel more comfortable with.

  I didn't see any need to use any native code for this test. but i'm working on a project since 4 months now
  where we are using a lot of native development due to need to run bluetooth, location  api in background.
  We can talk about it if we will have another interview.
